Although it aligns best in my class, and I push hard for participation in elections and voting, there is hardly a sophomore that doesn't have a hardened heart and ear to political discussion. The current climate of the political institutions in our country have filtered from the media to the parents, and the parents to the kids at the dinner table. 

I honestly fear that to lead an open discussion on politics in my own classroom, even though I feel completely confident in the knowledge of both parties on general topics to lead the discussion, it would end with me in hot water professionally. Parents are so quick to call for heads of teachers and anyone they disagree with, that it is easier to remain quiet with the lack of support in these instances.
